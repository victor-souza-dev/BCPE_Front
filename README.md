## 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the BCPE Front project! This is a React-based front-end application designed to seamlessly interact with our API for extracting CSS values and transforming them into JSON. This project leverages modern web development tools and libraries to provide a robust and user-friendly interface for managing CSS configurations and file uploads.

- ⚛️ React: Built with the latest version of React to ensure high performance and a responsive user experience.
- 📡 Axios: Utilized for making HTTP requests to the API, handling responses, and managing errors gracefully.
- ⚡ Vite: Employed for its fast build times and efficient development server capabilities.
- 🔒 TypeScript: Ensures type safety throughout the codebase, reducing bugs and improving maintainability.
- 🔔 Notistack: Provides a convenient way to display notifications and alerts within the application.
- 📦 React Query: Powerful data-fetching and state management for React applications.
- 📝 Commitizen: Enforces a standardized commit message format to maintain a clean and readable commit history.
- 🎨 MUI (Material-UI): Comprehensive library of UI components.
- 💾 Zustand: Small, fast, and scalable state-management solution.
- 🌍 i18next: Internationalization framework to provide multi-language support.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
To get started with the BCPE Front project, follow the steps below:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bcpe-front.git
cd bcpe-front
```
2. Install dependencies:

The build output will be located in the dist directory. You can specify a different output directory using the --out-dir option:
```

```
npm run build -- --out-dir=/path/to/output
```

## ⚙️ Configuration
Ensure you have the correct API base URL set in your environment variables or configuration files. You may need to adjust CORS settings in your backend to allow requests from your development server.
